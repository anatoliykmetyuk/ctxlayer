Currently supports only Mac OS and Linux. Requires Node.js/npm.

One command installs the CLI and agent skill:

{% include copyable-command.html command=site.data.commands.install %}

Uninstall (removes both CLI and agent skill):

{% include copyable-command.html command=site.data.commands.uninstall %}

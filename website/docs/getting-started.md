Currently supports only Mac OS and Linux. Requires Node.js/npm.

One command installs the CLI and agent skill:

{% include install-command.html %}

Uninstall (removes both CLI and agent skill):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anatoliykmetyuk/ctxlayer/main/uninstall.sh -o /tmp/ctxlayer-uninstall.sh && bash /tmp/ctxlayer-uninstall.sh
```
